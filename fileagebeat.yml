################### Fileagebeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Fileagebeat ######################################

fileagebeat:
  ##############################################################################
  # The primary configuration item is a list of inputs under fileagebeat.inputs.
  #
  # At this time there is only one type of input, a 'monitor'. A monitor will
  # only generate an event if a file's age exeeds the threshold. The beat will
  # generate one event for each file it finds that eceeds the threshold.
  # The only caveat to that is if heartbeat: true, which will generate a
  # heartbeat message each period.
  #
  # Each class requires a few parameters
  # - paths     : a list of absolute paths to directories to monitor. These must
  #               be directories, not files.
  # - period    : how often to check the paths, duration. Defaults to 60 seconds
  # - threshold : a period of time that if the file's age exceeds it it will be
  #               considered to be an aging file. Defaults to 60 sceonds.
  # - name      : A name for the input.
  #
  # Additionally there are several optional parameters for each monitor.
  # - enabled   : A boolean for to enable or disable the input. Default is true.
  # - whitelist : A list of regular expressions that will be tested against the
  #               the filenames. The filename must match one of these regexs to
  #               to be included in the monitoring. whitelist and blacklist are
  #               mutually exclusive.
  # - blacklist : A list of regular expressions that will be tested against the
  #               the filenames. Any file names found in the paths that match
  #               one of these regexs will be excluded from monitoring.
  #               blacklist and whitelist are mutually exclusive.
  # - max_depth : A restriction on how deeply into the directory structure of
  #               each path to descend. The default value is 0 which means no
  #               limit. Valid values are positive integers and zero.
  # - attribute : Specifies which attribute of the files that are found in the
  #               path to check the age of. Valid values are "mtime", "ctime",
  #               and "atime". The default value is "mtime".
  # - heartbeat : Enables a heartbeat message to be sent to the output on every
  #               period check. This is useful to know that the monitor is still
  #               running. This is a boolean value and the default is false.

    paths:
    - '/var/log'

    attribute: mtime
    hearbeat: true
  # - name: "monitor 2"
  #   type: monitor
  #   period: '5s'

#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging


#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here or by using the `setup` command.
#setup.dashboards.enabled: false

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

#============================== Kibana =====================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
setup.kibana:

  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
  #host: "localhost:5601"

  # Kibana Space ID
  # ID of the Kibana Space into which the dashboards should be loaded. By default,
  # the Default Space will be used.
  #space.id:

#============================= Elastic Cloud ==================================

# These settings simplify using fileagebeat with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` and
# `setup.kibana.host` options.
# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.
#cloud.id:

# The cloud.auth setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.username` and
# `output.elasticsearch.password` settings. The format is `<user>:<pass>`.
#cloud.auth:

#================================ Outputs =====================================

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

output.console:
  pretty: true

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
#output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  #hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

  # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
  #protocol: "https"
  #username: "elastic"
  #password: "changeme"

#----------------------------- Logstash output --------------------------------
#output.logstash:
  # The Logstash hosts
  #hosts: ["localhost:5044"]

  # Optional SSL. By default is off.
  # List of root certificates for HTTPS server verifications
  #ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"]

  # Certificate for SSL client authentication
  #ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

  # Client Certificate Key
  #ssl.key: "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"

#================================ Processors =====================================

# Configure processors to enhance or manipulate events generated by the beat.

#processors:
  #- add_host_metadata: ~
  #- add_cloud_metadata: ~

#================================ Logging =====================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]

#============================== Xpack Monitoring ===============================
# fileagebeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#monitoring.enabled: false

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
#monitoring.elasticsearch:

#================================= Migration ==================================

# This allows to enable 6.7 migration aliases
#migration.6_to_7.enabled: true
